    <h1>Creating the Max Sprite Sheet</h1>
    <br>
    <p>In DGA1020 we were required to practice building a sprite sheet by having a characer called "Max" perform six different functions.</p>
    <p>The frames themselves were created through <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com" target="_blank"><strong>Piskel</strong></a> and then exported as a single sheet.</p>
    <br>
    <img id="png" src="Max.png" alt="">
    <p>Frames of 'Max' showcasing 6 movements:</p>
    <li>Idle</li>
    <li>Walking</li>
    <li>Running</li>
    <li>Jumping</li>
    <li>Dying</li>
    <li>Falling</li>
    <br>
    <p>And here they are all in action:</p>

    <p>And just like that, I had a character ready to be animated for gameplay within Unity.</p>
